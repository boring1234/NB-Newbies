## Summary of the project
Our Minecraft-AI project is basically focus on auto mine cave minecrafting. The agent will start from an entrance of a cave and start collecting specific amount of mine from the mine cave. The agent will finish the task when it had collected specific amount of mine or finish exploring the whole cave. The agent will be given the information of all rock type and location that exists around agent in 10 block wide(This can be changed to input of visual sight from the agent).  The agent will learn to explore differnt kinds of cave itselve and avoid the danger(lava, deep hole..) 

## AI/ML algorithms
Our AI/ML algorithms will basically be reinforcement learning and other learning from Neural network. (Convolutional Neural Network learning if we add visual input into the project.) 

## Evaluation Plan
The ways to evaluated our AI is to count how many mine that agent can collect in a specific amount of time, the times that the agent died in the cave, percentage of completeness minecrafting for the whole cave.
