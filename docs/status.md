## Project Summary

Our project focuses on making the agent survive as long as possible during a creeper attack. The agent will be born in a random place on the platform and after 5 seconds the creepers will start emerging from random places on the map at a certain rate. The agent will be given information about the location of the creepers that exist around the agent. The agent needs to learn how to make the creepers explode and not hurt itself. The project can be divided into two parts. At first, we train the agent in a 1-dimensional graph. The agent can only move forward and backward and attack. Then, we implement it in a 2-dimensional graph.
