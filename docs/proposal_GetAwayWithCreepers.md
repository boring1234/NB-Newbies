## Summary of the project
Our project basically focus on survive as long as possible during a creepers attack. The player will born in a random place on the platform and after 5 seconds the creepers will start emerging from random places on the map in a certain rate. The player will be given information about the location of the creepers that exist around the user. The user need to learn how to make the creeper exploid and not hurt himself/herself. The project can be divided into two parts. At first, we train the player in a 1-dimensional graph. The player can only move forward and backward and attack. Then, we can implement it into a 2-dimensional graph. 

//We can also make the project in this way: We randomly generate traps in a graph and also zombies. We can train the players to move around and make the zombies drop into the traps. 

## AI/ML algorithms
Our AI/ML algorithms will basically be reinforcement learning and other learning from Neural network. (Convolutional Neural Network learning if we add visual input into the project.)

## Evaluation Plan
The way to evaluate our project is by the surviving time and the emerging rate of the creepers.
